# Training code for "Learned Image Compression with Discretized Gaussian Mixture Likelihoods and Attention Modules"

This repository contains the **training code** for the paper [1]. We implemented the training code based on the official inference code written in `Tensorflow 1.14`. The official repository can be found at [This GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ZhengxueCheng/Learned-Image-Compression-with-GMM-and-Attention), where the authors only provided inference code. 

## Environment

- python3
- Tensorflow==1.15.0
- Tensorflow-Compression==1.3
```
pip install tensorflow-compression==1.3
```
- RangeCoder
```
pip install range-coder
```

## Usage

```
TBD
```
